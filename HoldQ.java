/**
 * When a tokens lands on a hold queue, they are added to the end of a queue of tokens that landed there previously. They may only leave the space when no tokens are in the queue ahead of them, and when they roll the number they rolled to land on the hold queue. When a token is on a hold queue and are not in the front of the queue, they end their turn without rolling. When they are on a hold queue and are in the front of the queue, they roll, and if their roll is other than the one they entered with, the tokenâ€™s turn ends without moving. When the token rolls the required number, they advance the number of spaces rolled times a number specified for that hold space when the board is created, which will be between two numbers set in configuration.
