/**
 * When a player lands on a fair treasure pot, it gives that player a number of pieces specified by the gameâ€™s configuration. However, each pot can only give pieces to a certain number of players (also specified in configuration). If a player lands on the pot after the maximum number of players is reached, the pot is treated as a blank space. .
